### ðŸ§  Notes

* These prefixes are widely used in **Conventional Commits** spec: [https://www.conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)

* Format:

  ```
  <type>(optional scope): <description>
  ```

  Example:

  ```
  feat(auth): add OAuth2 support for Google
  fix(login): correct token expiration logic
  ```

* Tools like **semantic-release**, **commitlint**, and **standard-version** rely on these for automating changelogs and versioning.

Would you like a `.commitlintrc` config or templates for commit messages too?
